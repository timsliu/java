<h2>Lab 4:  Choosing and Saving Fractals</h2>
<!-- <i>Due Monday, November 6, 12:00pm.</i> -->

<p>
This week you will extend your Fractal Explorer with two new features.  First,
you will add support for multiple fractals, and allow the user to select which
fractal to display via a dropdown combo-box.  Second, you will add support for
saving the current fractal image into a data file.  Here is a screenshot of
what your new program will look like:
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="lab4.png" /></p>

<p>
The top of the Fractal Explorer now includes two widgets to let the user
select a fractal, and the bottom includes a new "Save" button to save the
current fractal image.
</p>

<p>
Since there will now be multiple action-event sources, you can practice
handling all of these sources with a single <tt>ActionListener</tt>
implementation in your class.
</p>

<h2>Supporting Multiple Fractals</h2>

<p>
It is very easy to add multiple fractals to your Fractal Explorer, particularly
because we introduced the <tt>FractalGenerator</tt> abstraction in our initial
implementation.  This week you will add support for multiple fractals, and the
user can choose between them using a <em>combo-box</em>.  This is a very common
"UI metaphor" (i.e. an interaction style that users are already familiar with
from many different user interfaces), so it should be very easy for people to
understand.  The Swing API provides combo-boxes via the
<tt>javax.swing.JComboBox</tt> class, and better yet, it fires
<tt>ActionEvent</tt>s when a new item is selected.  Here is what you need to do:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  <p>Create two new <tt>FractalGenerator</tt> implementations.</p>

  <p>
  The first will be the <em>tricorn</em> fractal, and should go in a file
  <tt>Tricorn.java</tt>.  As before, you should subclass
  <tt>FractalGenerator</tt>, and the implementation will be very nearly
  identical to the Mandelbrot fractal, except for two changes.  In fact, you
  might even copy the Mandelbrot source code, and just make the following
  tweaks.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The equation is <em>z<sub>n</sub></em> = <span style="text-decoration: overline"><em>z</em></span><sub><em>n</em>-1</sub><sup>2</sup> + <em>c</em>.
        The only difference here is that we take the complex conjugate of
        <em>z</em><sub><em>n</em>-1</sub> each iteration.
    </li>
    <li>The initial range for the tricorn fractal should be (-2, -2) to
        (2, 2).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  The second fractal to implement is the "Burning Ship" fractal, which does
  in fact look very similar to a burning ship.  The details are as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The equation is <em>z<sub>n</sub></em> = (|Re(<em>z</em><sub><em>n</em>-1</sub>)| + <em>i</em> |Im(<em>z</em><sub><em>n</em>-1</sub>)|)<sup>2</sup> + <em>c</em>.  In other words, you take the absolute value of each component
    of <em>z</em><sub><em>n</em>-1</sub> each iteration.</li>
    <li>The initial range for this fractal should be (-2, -2.5) to (2, 1.5).</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>
  Swing combo-boxes can manage a collection of objects, but the objects must
  provide an implementation of <tt>toString()</tt>.  Make sure to provide an
  implementation of <tt>toString()</tt> on each of the fractal implementations,
  that returns the name, e.g. "Mandelbrot", "Tricorn", and "Burning Ship".
</li>

<li>
  <p>
  It is very easy to set up a <tt>JComboBox</tt> in your user interface.  You
  can use the no-argument constructor, and then use the <tt>addItem(Object)</tt>
  method to add each of your <tt>FractalGenerator</tt> implementations.  As
  stated in the previous step, the combo-box will use the <tt>toString()</tt>
  method on your implementations to display the generators in the combo-box.
  </p>

  <p>
  You should also put a <em>label</em> into your user interface, before the
  combo-box, to explain what the combo-box is for.  You can do this by creating
  a new <tt>JPanel</tt> object, adding a <tt>JLabel</tt> object and a
  <tt>JComboBox</tt> object to it, and then putting the panel into your frame
  at the <tt>NORTH</tt> position in the frame's layout.
  </p>

  <p>
  Finally, you need to add support for your combo-box to your
  <tt>ActionListener</tt> implementation.  You can check whether the combo-box
  is the source of the action-event, and if it is, you can retrieve the
  currently selected item from the widget and set it to be the current fractal
  generator.  (You can use the <tt>getSelectedItem()</tt> method for this.)
  Don't forget to reset the initial range and redraw the fractal!
  </p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So that you can verify your work, here are the initial images for the Tricorn
and Burning Ship fractals:
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="tricorn.png" alt="Tricorn Fractal" />
<img src="ship.png" alt="Burning Ship Fractal" />
</p>

<h2>Saving the Fractal Image</h2>

<p>
Your other task for this week is to save the current fractal image to disk.
This might sound like a daunting task, but the Java API provides several tools
to make this very straightforward to implement.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  <p>
  The first thing you need to do to add this feature is to add a "Save Image"
  button to your display.  You can put both the Save and Reset buttons into a
  new <tt>JPanel</tt>, and then put this panel in the <tt>SOUTH</tt> region of
  the frame, similar to the way you added the label and combo-box.  (Note:
  Don't accidentally use the same panel object in both places, or you will get
  very strange results!)
  </p>

  <p>
  The Save button will also need to have its action-events handled by your
  <tt>ActionListener</tt> implementation.  You should give your Save and Reset
  buttons each their own action-command value (e.g. "save" and "reset"), so
  that the action-handler can distinguish between the two buttons.
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
  In your "Save button" handler, you need to allow the user to specify what
  file they are going to save the image into!  You can do this with the
  <tt>javax.swing.JFileChooser</tt> class, which makes it very easy.  This
  class provides a method <tt>showSaveDialog()</tt>, which pops up a "Save file"
  dialog allowing the user to select what directory and file to save to.  The
  method takes a graphics <tt>Component</tt> that is the parent of the chooser;
  this simply allows the chooser to be centered with respect to its parent.  Use
  the application's frame as the parent.
  </p>
  <p>
  You will also notice that this method returns an <tt>int</tt> value,
  specifying the outcome of the file-selection operation.  If the method returns
  <tt>JFileChooser.APPROVE_OPTION</tt> then you can go ahead with the file-save
  operation; otherwise, the user has canceled the request, so just return.
  If the user did select a place to save the file, it is available via the
  <tt>getSelectedFile()</tt> method, as a <tt>File</tt> object.
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
  You will also want to set up the file chooser to only save PNG images; that
  is the only format you will support for now.  You can do this with the
  <tt>javax.swing.filechooser.FileNameExtensionFilter</tt>, with a snippet of
  code like this:
  </p>

  <pre>  JFileChooser chooser = new JFileChooser();
  FileFilter filter = new FileNameExtensionFilter("PNG Images", "png");
  chooser.setFileFilter(filter);
  chooser.setAcceptAllFileFilterUsed(false);</pre>

  <p>
  The final line ensures that the chooser won't allow non-".png" filenames to
  be used.
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
  If the user has successfully selected a file, the next step is to save the
  fractal image to disk!  This would also be very complicated, except that
  again Java already includes this functionality.  The
  <tt>javax.imageio.ImageIO</tt> class provides simple image loading and
  storage operations; you can use the <tt>write(RenderedImage im,
  String formatName, File output)</tt> version.  The format will be "png".  The
  "RenderedImage" is simply the <tt>BufferedImage</tt> instance from your
  <tt>JImageDisplay</tt> component.  (You will need to provide a public
  accessor for this member.)
  </p>

  <p>
  Of course, you will also notice that the <tt>write()</tt> method might throw
  an exception, so you need to wrap this call in a <tt>try/catch</tt> block and
  handle the potential error.  Your <tt>catch</tt> block should inform the user
  of the error using a dialog window.  Again, Swing provides the
  <tt>javax.swing.JOptionPane</tt> class to simplify the process of creating
  informational dialogs, or getting yes/no input.  In this case, you can use the
  <tt>JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(Component parent, Object message, String title, int messageType)</tt> static method, with a message-type of
  <tt>JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE</tt>.  Your error message can be what the
  exception returns from its <tt>getMessage()</tt> method, and the title can be
  something descriptive like "Cannot Save Image".  As before, the parent
  component should be the frame, so that the error dialog is properly centered
  within the frame.
  </p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Once you are done with these features, give them a try!  You should now be able
to explore the various fractals and see them in all their beauty, and you should
also be able to save the images of what you see to disk.  You can also try out
your error-handling code by trying to save an image to a file that already
exists but is read-only, or perhaps to a read-only drive like a CD.  Or, you
can try saving to a file whose name is actually a directory in the target
folder.
</p>

<p>
Once you are convinced that everything works, submit your files to csman.

<h2>CS11 Java Lab 2:  I'm A Star!</h2>

<p>
If you have ever played any kind of map-based game on the computer, you have
probably encountered computer-controlled units that know how to get from point
A to point B all by themselves.  This is actually a common problem in both
games and other kinds of software, how to generate a path from a starting
location to a desired destination that successfully navigates obstacles.
</p>

<p>
One very widely used algorithm for this kind of problem is called A*
(pronounced "A-star"), and it is a very effective algorithm for pathfinding in
a computer program.  The algorithm is conceptually pretty simple.  Starting
with the initial location, it incrementally builds a path from the source to
the destination, always using the "best path so far" to take the next step.
This ensures that the final path will also be the optimal one.  (If you want
to learn much more about the A* pathfinding algorithm, you can start with the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%2A">Wikipedia article on A*</a>, and
follow the references the article gives.)
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, you don't have to implement the A* algorithm; this has already
been done for you.  In fact, there is even a nice little user interface for
you to experiment with the A* algorithm:
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="pathfinder.png" />
</p>

<p>
You can click on the various squares to turn them into barriers (red) or
passable cells (white).  The blue cells mark the start and end of the path.
Clicking on the "Find Path" button will compute a path using A*, and then
display it in green.  Or, if there is no path from start to end, the program
will simply not show any path.
</p>

<p>
The A* algorithm has a lot of information to keep track of, and the Java
collection classes are perfect for this kind of task.  There are two main
kinds of information that this A* implementation must manage:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Locations</b> are simply the sets of coordinates of specific cells on the
    two-dimensional map.  The A* algorithm must be able to refer to specific
    locations in the map.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Waypoints</b> are individual steps in the path that the A* algorithm
    generates.  For example, the above path in green is simply a sequence of
    waypoints through the map.  Each waypoint has several pieces of information
    associated with it:
    <ul>
      <li>The location of the cell that the waypoint is for.</li>
      <li>
        A reference to the previous waypoint in the path.  The final path is
        simply a sequence of waypoints from the destination back to the starting
        point.
      </li>
      <li>
        The actual cost of moving from the starting location to this waypoint's
        location, following the specific path ending with the waypoint.
      </li>
      <li>
        A heuristic estimate (a <em>guess</em>, in other words) of the remaining
        cost of traveling from this location to the final destination.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
As the A* algorithm builds its path, it must maintain two primary collections of
waypoints:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The first collection stores "open waypoints," or waypoints that still need
    to be considered by the A* algorithm.
  </li>

  <li>
    The second collection stores "closed waypoints," or waypoints that have
    already been considered by the A* algorithm and don't need to be examined
    again.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Each iteration of the A* algorithm is pretty simple:  find the least costly
  waypoint from the set of open waypoints, take a step in every direction from
  that waypoint to generate new open waypoints, and then move the waypoint from
  the open set to the closed set.  This is repeated until the current waypoint
  happens to be at the destination!  If, during this process, the algorithm
  runs out of open waypoints, there is no path from the starting point to the
  destination.
</p>

<p>
  This processing depends primarily on the locations of waypoints, so it is
  very useful to store waypoints as mappings from locations to their
  corresponding waypoints.  Thus, you will use the <tt>java.util.HashMap</tt>
  container for each of these collections, with <tt>Location</tt> objects as the
  keys, and <tt>Waypoint</tt> objects as the values.
</p>

<h3>Before You Begin</h3>

Before you begin, you should download the source files for this lab assignment:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="Map2D.java"><tt>Map2D.java</tt></a> - represents the map that the
    A* algorithm navigates, including whether cells are passable or not
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="Location.java"><tt>Location.java</tt></a> - this class represents
    the coordinates of a specific cell on the map
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="Waypoint.java"><tt>Waypoint.java</tt></a> - represents individual
    waypoints in the generated path
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="AStarPathfinder.java"><tt>AStarPathfinder.java</tt></a> - this
    class implements the A* pathfinding algorithm as a static method
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="AStarState.java"><tt>AStarState.java</tt></a> - this class stores
    the collections of open waypoints and closed waypoints, and provides basic
    operations necessary for the functioning of the A* algorithm
  </li>


  <li>
    <a href="AStarApp.java"><tt>AStarApp.java</tt></a> - a simple Swing
    application that provides an editable view of a 2D map, and initiates
    pathfinding when requested
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="JMapCell.java"><tt>JMapCell.java</tt></a> - this is a custom Swing
    component that is used to display the state of cells in the map
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Note that the application will compile successfully as-is, but the
  path-finding functionality won't work until you complete the assignment.
</p>

<p>
  The only classes you should have to edit will be <b><tt>Location</tt></b> and
  <b><tt>AStarState</tt></b>.  Everything else is framework code that allows
  you to edit the map and display the path that the algorithm generates.  (If
  you find yourself editing any of the other source files to get the lab to
  work then stop and ask for help!)
</p>

<h3>Locations</h3>

<p>
  The first thing that needs to be done is that the <tt>Location</tt> class
  must be prepared for use with the Java collection classes.  Since you will
  be using hashing containers for this assignment, this involves:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Providing an implementation of the <tt>equals()</tt> method.</li>
  <li>Providing an implementation of the <tt>hashCode()</tt> method.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Add an implementation of each of these methods to the <tt>Location</tt>
  class, following the patterns outlined in class.  Once this is completed,
  you can use the <tt>Location</tt> class as a key type in hashing
  containers like <tt>HashSet</tt> and <tt>HashMap</tt>.
</p>

<h3>A* State</h3>

<p>
  Once the <tt>Location</tt> class is ready to use as a key, you can finish the
  implementation of the <tt>AStarState</tt> class.  This is the class that
  maintains the sets of open and closed waypoints, so it really provides the
  core functionality for the A* implementation.
</p>

<p>
As mentioned previously, the A* state consists of two collections of waypoints,
one of open waypoints, and the other of closed waypoints.  To facilitate the
algorithm, waypoints will be stored in a hash-map, with the waypoint locations
being the keys and the waypoints themselves being the values.  Thus, you will
have a type like this:
</p>

<pre>    HashMap&lt;Location, Waypoint&gt;</pre>

<p>
(An obvious implication of this is that each map location can have only one
waypoint associated with it.  This is exactly what we want.)
</p>

<p>
Add two (non-static) fields to the <tt>AStarState</tt> class with this type, one
for "open waypoints" and the other for "closed waypoints."  Also, make sure to
initialize each of these fields to refer to a new, empty collection.
</p>

</p>
  Once you have the fields set up and initialized properly, you will need to
  implement the following methods on the <tt>AStarState</tt> class:
</p>

<ol>

  <li>
    <p><b><tt>public int numOpenWaypoints()</tt></b></p>

    <p>
      This method should simply return the number of waypoints in the collection
      of open waypoints.  (Yep it'll be a one-liner...)
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><b><tt>public Waypoint getMinOpenWaypoint()</tt></b></p>

    <p>
      This function should scan through all waypoints in the collection of open
      waypoints, and return a reference to the waypoint with the
      <em>smallest</em> total cost.  If there are no waypoints in the "open"
      collection, return <tt>null</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Don't remove the waypoint from the collection when you return it; just
      return a reference to the waypoint with the smallest total cost.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><b><tt>public boolean addOpenWaypoint(Waypoint newWP)</tt></b></p>

    <p>
      This is the most complicated method in the A* state class, but honestly it
      is still pretty simple.  What makes it more complicated than the rest is
      that it should only add the specified waypoint if an existing waypoint at
      the location is <em>worse</em> than the new one.  Here is what the method
      must do:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        If there is currently no waypoint for this location in the "open
        waypoints" collection then just add the new waypoint.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If there is <em>already</em> a waypoint for this location in the "open
          waypoints" collection, then only add the new waypoint if the "previous
          cost" for the new waypoint is less than the "previous cost" for the
          current waypoint.  (Make sure to use the <em>previous</em> cost and
          not the <em>total</em> cost.)  In other words, if the new waypoint
          represents a shorter path to that location than the current waypoint
          does, replace the current waypoint with the new one.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You can see that you will have to retrieve the existing waypoint from the
      "open" collection, if there is one, and act accordingly.  Fortunately, it
      is very simple to replace a previous waypoint with a new one; just use the
      <tt>HashMap.put()</tt> method like usual, and it will replace the old
      key-value mapping with the new one.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, have this method return <tt>true</tt> if the new waypoint was
      added to the collection of open waypoints, or <tt>false</tt> if the new
      waypoint wasn't actually added.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><b><tt>public boolean isLocationClosed(Location loc)</tt></b></p>

    <p>
      This function should return <tt>true</tt> if the specified location
      appears in the collection of closed waypoints, or false otherwise.  Since
      the closed waypoints are stored in a hash-map with locations as the key
      values, this should be quite simple to implement.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><b><tt>public void closeWaypoint(Location loc)</tt></b></p>

    <p>
      This function takes a waypoint and moves it from the collection of open
      waypoints to the collection of closed waypoints.  Since waypoints are
      keyed by their location, the method takes the location of the waypoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process should be simple:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Remove the waypoint corresponding to the specified location from the
        collection of open waypoints.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the waypoint you just removed, to the collection of closed
        waypoints.  Of course, the key should be the location of the waypoint.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

</ol>

<h3>Compiling and Testing</h3>

<p>
  Once you get the above functionality implemented, give the pathfinding program
  a run to see if it works properly.  If you have implemented everything
  correctly, you shouldn't have any problem creating obstacles and then finding
  paths around them.
</p>

<p>
You can compile and run the program the same way as always:
</p>

<pre>
    javac *.java
    java AStarApp</pre>

<p>
  After you have convinced yourself that everything works correctly, go ahead
  and submit your work via <a href="https://csman.cs.caltech.edu">csman</a>!

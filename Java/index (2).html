<h2>Java Lab 3:  Fractal Explorer</h2>

<p>
For the next few labs you will put together a fun little Java application that
can draw some amazing fractals.  If you have never played with fractals before,
you will be amazed at how easy it is to create some breathtakingly beautiful
images.  We will do this all with the Swing Framework, the Java API that allows
you to create graphical user interfaces.
</p>

<p>
We will be building this application over multiple labs, so our initial version
will be pretty simple, but we will build it up over the next few labs to
include some neat features, like being able to save the images we generate, and
being able to switch between different kinds of fractals.  Both the GUI itself
and the mechanism for supporting different fractals will depend on class
hierarchies.
</p>

<p>
Here is a simple example of the GUI in its initial state:
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="explorer.png" />
</p>

<p>
And, here are some interesting areas of the fractal:  elephants and seahorses!
</p>

</p>

<h2>Creating the User Interface</h2>

<p>
Before we can draw any fractals, we'll need to create a graphics widget that
will allow us to display them.  Swing doesn't provide such a component, but it
is very easy to create one ourselves.  Note that we will be using a wide range
of Java AWT and Swing classes in this lab, and there is simply no way we can
explain the details of each one.  However, there is no need to, because the
online <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/">Java API docs</a>
are very comprehensive and easy to use.  Just navigate to the package of a
given Java class, select the class itself, and then read the detailed
information about how to use the class.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Create a class <tt>JImageDisplay</tt> that derives from
    <tt>javax.swing.JComponent</tt>.  The class should have one private field,
    an instance of a <tt>java.awt.image.BufferedImage</tt>.  The
    <tt>BufferedImage</tt> class manages an image whose contents we can
    actually write to.
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
    The <tt>JImageDisplay</tt> constructor should take an integer width and
    height, and initialize its <tt>BufferedImage</tt> member to be a new image
    of that width and height, and an image-type of <tt>TYPE_INT_RGB</tt>.  The
    type simply specifies how each pixel's colors are represented in the image;
    this particular value means that the red, green, and blue components are
    each 8 bits, and they appear in the int in that order.
    </p>
    <p>
    Your constructor must do one other thing too:  it must call the parent
    class' <tt>setPreferredSize()</tt> method with the specified width and
    height.  (You will have to pass these values in a
    <tt>java.awt.Dimension</tt> object you create specifically for this call.)
    This way, when your component is included in the user interface, it will
    actually display the entire image.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    Custom Swing components must provide their own drawing code by overriding
    the <tt>protected paintComponent(Graphics g)</tt> method of
    <tt>JComponent</tt>.  Since our component will simply display the image
    data itself, our implementation will be very simple!  First, the superclass
    <tt>paintComponent(g)</tt> implementation must <u>always</u> be called, so
    that any borders or other features are drawn properly.  Once you have
    called the superclass version, you can draw the image into the component
    using an operation like this:
    <pre>  g.drawImage(image, 0, 0, image.getWidth(), image.getHeight(), null);</pre>
    (We are passing <tt>null</tt> for the <tt>ImageObserver</tt>, since we
    don't need that functionality.)
  </li>

  <li>
    You also need to provide two public methods for writing data into the
    image:  a <tt>clearImage()</tt> method that sets all pixels in the image
    data to black (RGB value 0), and a <tt>drawPixel(int x, int y,
    int rgbColor)</tt> method that sets a pixel to have a specific color.
    Both of these methods will need to use one of the <tt>setRGB()</tt> methods
    on the <tt>BufferedImage</tt> class.
  </li>

  <li>
    Of course, don't forget to write clear, complete and concise documentation
    for your class and methods, explaining what everything does.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Computing the Mandelbrot Fractal</h2>

<p>
Next you will write the code to compute the very well-known Mandelbrot fractal.
In order to support multiple fractals in the future, you are provided with the
<a href="FractalGenerator.java"><tt>FractalGenerator.java</tt></a> source file,
which all of your fractal generators will derive from.  You will also notice
that some very helpful operations are provided to translate from screen
coordinates into the coordinate-system of the fractal being computed.
</p>

<p>
The kinds of fractals we will be working with are computed in the complex plane,
and involve very simple mathematical functions that are iterated repeatedly
until some condition is satisfied.  For the Mandelbrot fractal, the function is
<em>z<sub>n</sub></em> = <em>z</em><sub><em>n</em>-1</sub><sup>2</sup> +
<em>c</em>, where all values are complex numbers, <em>z</em><sub>0</sub> = 0,
and <em>c</em> is the particular point in the fractal that we are displaying.
This computation is iterated until either |<em>z</em>| > 2 (in which case the
point is not in the Mandelbrot set), or until the number of iterations hits a
maximum value, e.g. 2000 (in which case we assume the point is in the set).
</p>

<p>
The process of plotting the Mandelbrot set is very simple:  we simply iterate
over each pixel in our image, compute the number of iterations for the
corresponding coordinate, and then set the pixel to a color based on the number
of iterations we computed.  But, we will get to this in a second - for now, you
simply need to implement the above computation.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Create a subclass of <tt>FractalGenerator</tt> called <tt>Mandelbrot</tt>.
    You will see that there are only two methods that you need to provide in
    the subclass, <tt>getInitialRange()</tt> and <tt>numIterations()</tt>.
  </li>

  <li>
    The <tt>getInitialRange(Rectangle2D.Double)</tt> method simply allows the
    fractal generator to specify what part of the complex plane is the most
    "interesting" for a particular fractal.  Note that the rectangle object is
    passed as an argument to the method, and the method must modify the
    rectangle's fields to reflect the proper initial range for the fractal.
    (You can see an example of this in the
    <tt>FractalGenerator.recenterAndZoomRange()</tt> method.)  The
    <tt>Mandelbrot</tt> implementation of this method should set the initial
    range to (-2 - 1.5<em>i</em>) - (1 + 1.5<em>i</em>).  That is, the
    <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> values will be -2 and -1.5 respectively, and the
    width and height will both be 3.
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
    The <tt>numIterations(double, double)</tt> method will implement the
    iterative function for the Mandelbrot fractal.  You can define a constant
    for the "maximum iterations" like this:
    <pre>  public static final int MAX_ITERATIONS = 2000;</pre>
    Then you can refer to this value in your implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
    Note that Java has no data type for complex numbers, so you will need to
    implement the iterative function using separate <tt>double</tt> components
    for the real and imaginary parts.  (I suppose you could implement your own
    complex number class, but that will probably not be worth it.)  You should
    try to make your implementation fast; for example, don't compare
    |<em>z</em>| to 2; compare |<em>z</em>|<sup>2</sup> to 2<sup>2</sup> to
    avoid nasty and slow square-root computations.  And don't use
    <tt>Math.pow()</tt> to compute small integer powers; multiply them out
    directly, otherwise your code will be very slow.
    </p>
    <p>
    Finally, when you are iterating your function, if you hit
    <tt>MAX_ITERATIONS</tt> then simply return -1 to indicate that the point
    didn't escape outside of the boundary.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b>  Note that the equation to iterate is:
    <em>z<sub>n</sub></em> = <em>z</em><sub><em>n</em>-1</sub><sup>2</sup> +
    <em>c</em>.  That is, each iteration you are to compute
    <em>z<sub>n</sub></em> from <em>z</em><sub><em>n</em>-1</sub>.  Students
    frequently make the mistake of writing code like this:
<pre>    int numIterations(double re, double im) {
        ... (loop and stuff) ...

        re = (some expression involving re and im);
        im = (some expression involving re and im);

        ...
    }</pre>
    Of course, the computation of <tt>im</tt> is incorrect since <tt>re</tt>
    was changed by the previous step.
    </p>
    <p>
    Instead, compute the value of <em>z<sub>n</sub></em> into a new set of
    variables:
<pre>        double nextRe = (some expression involving re and im);
        double nextIm = (some expression involving re and im);

        re = nextRe;
        im = nextIm;</pre>
    This will avoid bizarre results from being displayed.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

<p>
Finally we are ready to begin displaying fractals!  Now you will create a
<tt>FractalExplorer</tt> class that allows you to examine different parts of
the fractal by creating and showing a Swing GUI, and handling events caused by
various user interactions.
</p>

<p>
As you can see from the above images of the user interface, the Fractal
Explorer is very simple, consisting of a <tt>JFrame</tt> containing a
<tt>JImageDisplay</tt> object that displays the fractal, and a single
<tt>JButton</tt> for resetting the display to show the entire fractal.  You can
achieve this simple layout by setting the frame to have a <tt>BorderLayout</tt>,
then putting the display in the center of the layout, and the reset button in
the "south" part of the layout.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Your <tt>FractalExplorer</tt> class will need to keep track of several
    important fields for the program's state:
    <ul>
      <li>An integer "display size", which is simply the width and height of
          the display in pixels.  (Our fractal display will be square.)</li>
      <li>A <tt>JImageDisplay</tt> reference, so that we can update our
          display from various methods, as we compute the fractal.</li>
      <li>A <tt>FractalGenerator</tt> object.  We will use a base-class
          reference so that we can show other kinds of fractals in the
          future.</li>

      <li>A <tt>Rectangle2D.Double</tt> object specifying the range of the
          complex plane that we are currently displaying.</li>
    </ul>
    Of course, all of these fields will be private...
  </li>

  <li>
    The class should have a constructor that takes a display-size as an
    argument, then stores this value in the corresponding field, and also
    initializes the range and fractal-generator objects.  Note that the
    constructor shouldn't set up any Swing components; these will be set up in
    the next method.
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
    Provide a <tt>createAndShowGUI()</tt> method that initializes the Swing
    GUI:  a <tt>JFrame</tt> containing a <tt>JImageDisplay</tt> object and a
    button for resetting the display.  You should set the frame to use a
    <tt>java.awt.BorderLayout</tt> for its contents; add the image-display
    object in the <tt>BorderLayout.CENTER</tt> position, and the button in the
    <tt>BorderLayout.SOUTH</tt> position.
    </p>
    <p>
    You should also give the frame a suitable title for your application, and
    set the frame's default close operation to "exit" (see the
    <tt>JFrame.setDefaultCloseOperation()</tt> method).
    </p>
    <p>
    Finally, after the UI components are initialized and laid out, include this
    sequence of operations:

    <pre>  frame.pack();
  frame.setVisible(true);
  frame.setResizable(false);</pre>

    This will properly lay out the contents of the frame, cause it to be
    visible (windows are not initially visible when they are created, so that
    you can configure them before displaying them), and then disallow resizing
    of the window.
  </li>

  <li>
    You should implement a private helper method to display the fractal, e.g.
    called <tt>drawFractal()</tt>.  This method should loop through every pixel
    in the display (i.e. <em>x</em> will range from 0 to display-size, as will
    <em>y</em>), and do the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Compute the number of iterations for the corresponding coordinates in
        the fractal's display area.  You can determine the floating-point
        coordinates for a specific set of pixel coordinates using the
        <tt>FractalGenerator.getCoord()</tt> helper method; for example, to
        to get the x-coordinate corresponding to a pixel-X coordinate, you
        would do this:
        <pre>  // x is the pixel-coordinate; xCoord is the coordinate in the fractal's space
  double xCoord = FractalGenerator.getCoord(range.x, range.x + range.width, displaySize, x);</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        If the number of iterations is -1 (i.e. the point doesn't escape, se
        the pixel's color to black (rgb value 0).  Otherwise, you need to
        choose a value based on the number of iterations.  We can actually use
        the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSV_color_space">HSV color
        space</a> for this:  as the hue ranges from 0 to 1, we get a smooth
        sequence of colors from red through yellow, green, blue, violet, and
        then back to red!  You can use an operation like this:
        <pre>  float hue = 0.7f + (float) numIters / 200f;
  int rgbColor = Color.HSBtoRGB(hue, 1f, 1f);</pre>
        Of course, if you come up with some other interesting way to color
        pixels based on the number of iterations, feel free to use it!
      </li>
      <li>
        Of course, the display needs to be updated with the color for each
        pixel, so you will use your <tt>drawPixel()</tt> operation from earlier.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, when you have finished drawing <u>all</u> pixels, you need to
        force the <tt>JImageDisplay</tt> to be repainted to match the current
        contents of its image.  Do this by calling <tt>repaint()</tt> on the
        component.  If you forget to do this, your display will never update!
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
    Create an inner class to handle <tt>java.awt.event.ActionListener</tt>
    events from the reset button.  The handler simply needs to reset the range
    to the initial range specified by the generator, and then draw the fractal.
    </p>
    <p>
    Once you have completed this class, update your <tt>createAndShowGUI()</tt>
    method to register an instance of this handler on the reset button.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
    Create another inner class to handle <tt>java.awt.event.MouseListener</tt>
    events from the display.  Really you only need to handle mouse-click events,
    so you should derive this inner class from the <tt>MouseAdapter</tt> AWT
    class mentioned in the lecture 3 slides.  When this handler receives a
    mouse-click event, it should map the click pixel-coordinates into the area
    of the fractal that is being displayed, and then call the generator's
    <tt>recenterAndZoomRange()</tt> method with the coordinates that were
    clicked, and a scale of 0.5.  This way, just by clicking on a location in
    the fractal display will zoom in on that location!
    </p>
    <p>
    Of course, don't forget to redraw the fractal after you have altered the
    area of the fractal being displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
    After this class is done, update your <tt>createAndShowGUI()</tt> method to
    register an instance of this handler on the fractal-display component.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    Finally, you need to create a static <tt>main()</tt> method for the
    fractal explorer so that it can be launched.  The main method will be very
    simple at the moment:
    <ul>
      <li>Initialize a new <tt>FractalExplorer</tt> instance with a display-size
          of 800 (or whatever suits you, but not too large).</li>
      <li>Call <tt>createAndShowGUI()</tt> on the explorer object.</li>
      <li>Call <tt>drawFractal()</tt> on the explorer to see the initial
          view!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Once you have completed all these steps, you should be able to cruise around
the Mandelbrot fractal looking at the amazing detail.  If you zoom in enough
you will run into two interesting issues:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  First, you will eventually find that the level of detail eventually runs out;
  this is because we would need more than 2000 iterations to find out if the
  point is in the Mandelbrot set or not!  Of course, we might be tempted to
  increase the maximum iterations, but then the black areas of the fractal
  would <em>really</em> slow us down!
  </li>

  <li>
  Second, if you zoom in <em>really</em> far, you will eventually run into
  pixellated display output!  This is because you are running into the limit of
  what double-precision floating-point values can represent.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
You will probably also notice that it is kind of annoying how the entire
display hangs while the fractal is being drawn.  This is something we will
explore in future labs, as well as taking advantage of multiple processors to
draw our fractals much faster.  But for now, once you have your Fractal
Explorer completed (and well commented), you can submit your work to
<a href="http://csman.cs.caltech.edu">csman</a>!

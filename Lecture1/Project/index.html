  <h2>Java Lab 1:  Diving Right In</h2>

  <p>
    Java lets us program with <i>objects</i>.  We use <i>classes</i>, one per
    file, to describe how these objects work -- a blueprint, if you will.  Here
    is the code for a simple class that represents a two-dimensional point:
  </p>

<pre>
/**
 * A two-dimensional point class.
 */
public class Point2d {
    
    /** X coordinate of the point */
    private double xCoord;
    
    /** Y coordinate of the point */
    private double yCoord;

    /** Constructor to initialize point to (x, y) value. */
    public Point2d(double x, double y) {
        xCoord = x;
        yCoord = y;
    }

    /** No-argument constructor:  defaults to a point at the origin. */
    public Point2d() {
        // Call two-argument constructor and specify the origin.
        this(0, 0);
    }

    /** Return the X coordinate of the point. */
    public double getX() {
        return xCoord;
    }

    /** Return the Y coordinate of the point. */
    public double getY() {
        return yCoord;
    }

    /** Set the X coordinate of the point. */
    public void setX(double val) {
        xCoord = val;
    }

    /** Set the Y coordinate of the point. */
    public void setY(double val) {
        yCoord = val;
    }
}
</pre>

  <p>
    This code <i>must</i> be saved in a file called
    <a href="Point2d.java"><tt>Point2d.java</tt></a>, due to Java's
    requirements on class names and file names.  A copy of this file is
    provided for your consumption; you might save a copy of it to your working
    directory and build off of it for this lab.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recall that we can <i>instantiate</i> our class anywhere else in our code by
    calling any of the constructors we've defined, like so:
  </p>

<pre>
    Point2d myPoint = new Point2d();            // creates a point at (0,0)
    Point2d myOtherPoint = new Point2d(5,3);    // creates a point at (5,3)
    Point2d aThirdPoint = new Point2d();
</pre>

  <p>
    Be careful:  <tt>myPoint <b>!=</b> aThirdPoint</tt>, even though their
    values are the same!  This is because the equality operator <tt>==</tt> (and
    its inverse, the inequality operator <tt>!=</tt>) compare the two object
    <i>references</i> for equality.  In other words, <tt>==</tt> returns true if
    the two references point to the <i>same</i> object.  In this code,
    <tt>myPoint</tt> and <tt>aThirdPoint</tt> each refers to a different
    instance of the <tt>Point2d</tt> class, so <tt>myPoint == aThirdPoint</tt>
    returns <tt>false</tt>, even though their values are the same!
  </p>

  <p>
    To test for value-equality and not reference-equality, we define a method of
    the <tt>Point2d</tt> class called <tt>equals</tt>, which takes another
    <tt>Object</tt> as an argument, and performs the appropriate tests for
    equality.  Remember that the object being compared must be the correct
    type, and its member-fields must have the same values as well.
  </p>

<h3>Before you start coding away...</h3>

<p>
  Coding style is very important in any software project that you work on.
  Believe it or not, the <em>vast majority</em> of a successful program's
  lifetime is spent in the debugging and maintenance phases.  In these phases
  of a product's lifecycle, well-documented and readable code becomes a huge
  asset, saving massive amounts of time.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, the value of good coding style is often learned only through
  painful experience...  But, CS11 is a good opportunity to learn and practice
  good coding style.  Before you start on this assignment, review the
  <a href="../javastyle.html">CS11 Java Style Guidelines</a>.  There is even a
  helpful style-checker on the CS cluster, that will report any issues with
  your program.
</p>

<h3>Your task:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Create a new class <tt>Point3d</tt> to represent, you guessed it, points
      in three dimensional Euclidean space.  It should be possible to:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            create a new <tt>Point3d</tt> described by any three floating-point
            (type <tt>double</tt>) values,
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            create a new <tt>Point3d</tt> at (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) by default,
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            access and mutate all three values individually, and
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            compare two <tt>Point3d</tt>s for value-equality using an
            appropriate <tt>equals</tt> method.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      It should <u>not</u> be possible to directly access the internal data
      members of any <tt>Point3d</tt> object.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Furthermore, add a new method <tt>distanceTo</tt> which takes another
      <tt>Point3d</tt> as an argument, and computes a double-precision
      floating-point approximation of the straight-line distance between the
      two points, and returns that value.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Create a second class called <tt>Lab1</tt> that exists primarily to house
      the static method <tt>main</tt>.  Remember that <tt>main</tt> must be
      <tt>public</tt>, have a <tt>void</tt> return type, and accept an array of
      <tt>String</tt>s as an argument.  Inside this class, add some
      functionality:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Input three ordered triples from the user, each representing the
            coordinates of one point in 3-space.  Generate three
            <tt>Point3d</tt> objects from this data.  (For now, you can assume
            that the user will not enter invalid data.)
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don't know how to get input from the user, you can use the
            function in <a href="inp.java">this file</a>.  Put it as a static
            method in your <tt>Lab1</tt> class.  Note that this method uses
            classes in the <tt>java.io</tt> package, which is not visible to
            your code by default.  To make it visible, add this to the very top
            of your file:

            <pre>    import java.io.*;</pre>

            This makes all classes in the <tt>java.io</tt> package visible to
            your <tt>Lab1</tt> code.  (You don't have to do this with the
            classes in the <tt>java.lang</tt> package, since those are made
            available to your classes by default.)
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Write a second static method <tt>computeArea</tt> which takes three
            <tt>Point3d</tt>'s and computes the area within the triangle bounded
            by them.  (You may wish to use
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula">Heron's
            formula</a>.)  Return this area as a <tt>double</tt>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Use the data and code you gathered and wrote above to determine the
	    area and print that out for the user's consumption.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <em>Before</em> you call <tt>computeArea</tt>, however, test for
	    value equality between all of the three <tt>Point3d</tt>'s.  If
	    any pair of points is "equal", report this to the user and do not
	    compute an area.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Compile both of your source files together:

      <pre>    javac Point3d.java Lab1.java</pre>

      and then run your <tt>Lab1</tt> program, testing it with several sample
      triangles.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      When you are finished with lab 1, you can submit your files on the
      <a href="https://csman.cs.caltech.edu">csman website</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
